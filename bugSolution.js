A reliable solution hasn't been identified within the Expo framework itself. However, a workaround to improve reliability is to use event listeners to capture deep links. This method involves subscribing to the `Linking.addEventListener`  for the 'url' event. This provides more consistent results than relying solely on the initial URL retrieval. 

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

useEffect(() => {
  const handleUrl = (event) => {
    // Handle the deep link here
    console.log('Deep link received:', event.url);
  };

  Linking.addEventListener('url', handleUrl);

  return () => {
    Linking.removeEventListener('url', handleUrl);
  };
}, []);
```
This approach ensures that any deep link received will be properly handled, even if `getInitialURL` fails for any reason on Android.
